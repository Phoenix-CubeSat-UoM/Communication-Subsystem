# 📡 Weather Balloon Communication Group

Welcome to the **Weather Balloon Communication Group**!  
Step into the fascinating field of **communication engineering** through our Weather Balloon Programme — a hands-on initiative focused on the real-world applications of **wireless communication** and **signal processing**.

## 🌤️ What We Do

As part of the **Communication Group**, you'll play a vital role in:

- Receiving and decoding data transmitted from high-altitude **radiosondes**
- Enabling **live tracking and analysis** of weather balloon telemetry
- Applying communication theory to real-world scenarios

Weather balloons can soar up to **30+ km** above the Earth — and we stay connected the entire time.

## 🔧 Technologies & Tools You’ll Work With

- 📶 **LoRa (Long Range)** communication systems  
- 🛰️ **SDR (Software Defined Radio)** receivers and platforms  
- 📡 **RF (Radio Frequency)** signal processing  
- 🧠 **Real-time signal decoding** and **data extraction**  
- 🗺️ **Tracking and visualization** of balloon flight paths

## 🚀 Why Join?

Whether you're **just starting out** or seeking to **deepen your expertise** in wireless systems, this program offers a unique, immersive experience to:

- Apply classroom theory in **practical fieldwork**
- Gain exposure to **cutting-edge communication tools**
- Collaborate with peers on exciting **live experiments**
